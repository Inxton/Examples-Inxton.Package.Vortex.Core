#  AddedProperties

This example is trying to expose the feature that allows you to introduce additional properties to twin objects in the PLC code. This feature is part of wider idea that is called "Single Point of Change" (SPOC).

> In short SPOC tends to keep the changes in a single place (which in this instance is the source code of the PLC program), later in more advanced packages we will show how this concept keeps the solutions clean and consistent yet at the same time it takes a lot of workload away from the developer.

# How it looks like

Inxton is reading the variable from PLC and displaying it
