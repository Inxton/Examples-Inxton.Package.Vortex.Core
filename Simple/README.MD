# Simple

*Simple* examples have a rudimentary plc counter. We aimed to show basic manipulation with twins of the PLC. Accessing variables, reading, writing, displaying (WPF, and WinForms).

> REMARKS: It is possible to use WinForms to create the valuable applications. WinForm offers simple approach, you might be more familiar with the technology. On the other hand it requires more manual coding. If you want, however get the best from the framework consider starting with WPF. WPF offers very powerful data binding, styling, templates, effective work with components. WPF on the other hand has usually slowly climbing learning curve for classical programmers. It is however worth the effort.

# How it looks like
