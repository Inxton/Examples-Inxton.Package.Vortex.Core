# Weather stations

In this example we are showing the ease with which you can use the power of .NET ecosystem with the PLC. We are reading the data from some weather stations from around the world (via .net library) and we pass the data to the PLC. Plc then makes its own statements about the weather situation in different parts of the world.

Console application shows different ways to access PLCs' variables (Cyclical, Synchronous, Batched). There are descriptive comments in the code that should help you grasp basic concepts.

In addition this project demonstrates the ability to localize PLC strings in easy and straightforward way. The framework takes care of translating PLC STRING, WSTRING at runtime using applications' resources. Notice that localizable PLC strings are enclosed between <# and #>.
